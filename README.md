# machine-learning-kaggle-project

This repository includes my side projects of machine learning. Most of dataset come from Kaggle. I use these pet projects to practice the machine learning models and frameworks. 

Any comments or suggestions to improve either the model or data-processing are highly welcome! ðŸ˜‰Â 

## 1. Kaggle Project:

### * Iris Classification

This project tries to classify different Iris samples into three categories. I use training set to build a simple model, and test out its performance on testing dataset. Please see file "Iris/Iris-classification-kaggle.ipynb" for implementation.


## 2. mini projects

### * Student-Admission problem:
This project predicts if the student will be admitted to a graduate school based on features, including GPA, GRE score, and undergraduate school ranks. We practice basic operations and techniques for general machine learning solutions..

There are two solutions:
* single layer model: there is only one output layer without any intermediate hidden layer. 

	-  see "student_admission_single_layer_model.ipynb"

* multiple layer model: there is one hidden layer and one output layer.
	- see "student_admission_multiple_layer_model.ipynb"
