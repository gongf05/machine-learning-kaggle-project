# machine-learning-kaggle-project

This repository includes my side projects of machine learning. Most of dataset come from Kaggle. I use these pet projects to practice the machine learning models and frameworks. The list keeps growing as I add more projects here. Any comments or suggestions to improve either the model or data-processing are highly welcome! ðŸ˜‰Â
