# machine-learning-kaggle-project

This repository includes my side projects of machine learning. Most of dataset come from Kaggle. I use these pet projects to practice the machine learning models and frameworks. 

Any comments or suggestions to improve either the model or data-processing are highly welcome! ðŸ˜‰Â 

## 1. Kaggle Project:

### * Iris Classification

This project tries to classify different Iris samples into three categories. I use training set to build a simple model, and test out its performance on testing dataset. Please see file "Iris/Iris-classification-kaggle.ipynb" for implementation.
